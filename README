DESCRIPTION
Software::Packager is a suite of Perl modules providing a common interface for
the creation of platform specific software installation packagers.

If you release software for a range of platforms then this is the module for
you. 

This module does not do the packaging of the software but is merely a wrapper
around the various software packaging tools already provided with various
operating systems.
